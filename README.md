# Software-Complaints
Public complaints about software not working as expected.

| Subject | Complaint |
| - | - |
| Dependencies during installations | When attempting to install Aragon, I run into problem after problem caused by dependencies failing to initialize their own dependencies, leaving me with partially installed software that doesn't run that also can't be salvaged because the installation scripts assume everything works in a single go. |
| Forced translations | When I load a website, I want to have the choice whether I want the page translated or not, don't choose for me. Because almost always, the translations are so bad that I'd rather read it in the original language so important parts are not mistranslated. |
| Informative operating systems | Every single operating system I have ever used has this annoying tendency to hide everything that is going on to the point where it becomes unclear why some programs are behaving the way they are. Why is there no operating system that will actually tell me why a button isn't responding to my clicks and what I could do to make it work? |
| Installations with side-effects | I ran into an argument because I thought code wasn't working, but it was caused by an unrelated installation adding PATH variables, which broke some multi-level compilation script. |
| Unprofessional professionals | I recently had the joy of having to work with open source software that had some great open issues such as "Get it working on Windows" and "Fix master branch". Things like this should cost you many users, but because they have a pretty front-page, nobody really cares. |
| Unreadable error logs | Don't you just love it when you install 1400 dependencies with npm and you not only see advertisements in your log, but also 7 different formats of logging, including fullwidth text including full paths and no formatting? |
| Virtualization | When given some 10 year old VMWare file, I had to convert it to an open format and then convert it to a format that Hyper-V could use, purely because VMWare doesn't work well when Hyper-V is running. You would think that something like virtualization would have a proper standard that every system adheres to. |
