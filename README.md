# Software-Complaints
Public complaints about software not working as expected.

| Subject | Complaint |
| - | - |
| Dependencies during installations | When attempting to install Aragon, I run into problem after problem caused by dependencies failing to initialize their own dependencies, leaving me with partially installed software that doesn't run that also can't be salvaged because the installation scripts assume everything works in a single go. |
| Installations with side-effects | I ran into an argument because I thought code wasn't working, but it was caused by an unrelated installation adding PATH variables, which broke some multi-level compilation script |
| Unreadable error logs | Don't you just love it when you install 1400 dependencies with npm and you not only see advertisements in your log, but also 7 different formats of logging, including fullwidth text including full paths and no formatting? |
| Virtualization | When given some 10 year old VMWare file, I had to convert it to an open format and then convert it to a format that Hyper-V could use, purely because VMWare doesn't work well when Hyper-V is running. You would think that something like virtualization would have a proper standard that every system adheres to. |
